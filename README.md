# Animotion Examples

## Description

This repository contains the slides I use to make educational content for the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) videos.

Some projects use older Animotion versions, but you can still look at the utilities I use for the slides and use them in your own projects.

I plan to include the most used and tested utilities eventually as part of Animotion, but for now I'm keeping them here as they're constantly evolving to suit my needs.

## Instructions

The simplest way to try any of the examples is to `cd` into the directory you're interested in, install the dependencies, and run the development server.

Install dependencies using the package manager of your choice:

```sh
pnpm i
```

Run the development server at http://localhost:5173/:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Building the project:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the build at http://localhost:5174/:

```sh
pnpm run preview
```
