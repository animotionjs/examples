# Animotion Examples

This is a repo dedicated to how I use Animotion to make [educational YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) if you want to learn how you can use Animotion.

You can try the examples in the browser thanks to [SvelteLab](https://www.sveltelab.dev/) but there's also instructions if you want to try it yourself.

Don't take any of these examples as how you should do something but more of an inspiration.
