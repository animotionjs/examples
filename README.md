# Animotion Examples

This is a repo dedicated to Animotion examples I used to make [educational YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) if you want to learn how you can use Animotion.

You can try the examples in the browser thanks to [SvelteLab](https://www.sveltelab.dev/) but there's also instructions if you want to try it yourself.
