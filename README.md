# Animotion Examples

> ⚠️ These examples use an older Animotion version and are outdated.

This is a learning repo for Animotion examples I use to make educational content for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev).

You can try the examples in the browser thanks to [SvelteLab](https://www.sveltelab.dev/) but there's also instructions for local development.

Please don't take any of these examples as how you should do something but more of an inspiration to achieve your goals.
