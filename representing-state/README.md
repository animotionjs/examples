# Avoid Representing State With Booleans

You can watch [Avoid Representing State With Booleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lom_lqSGoY) to see the final presentation.

Inside `theme.css` I set a `max-height` for code blocks to get the scrolling effect.

```css
.reveal pre code {
	max-height: 600px;
	/* ... */
}
```
